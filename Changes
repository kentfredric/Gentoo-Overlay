1.0.2 2012-06-21T11:34:49Z
 [Internals]
 - Refactor iteration logic to use a dispatch table depending on what you

   internal calling code faster and cleaner.

   ugly and buggy.

0.03000000 2011-02-10T22:15:53Z
 - Eliminate 'tie' in favour of ->open + ->read
 - Throw Exceptions. Even warnings are exceptions now. You can't catch

   local $Gentoo::Overlay::Exceptions::WARNINGS_ARE='fatal'; )
 - Added an ( currently undocumented ) iteration interface.
