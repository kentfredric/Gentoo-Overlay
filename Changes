Revision history for Gentoo-Overlay

0.03000000 2011-02-11 11:15:53 Pacific/Auckland
         Eliminate 'tie' in favour of ->open + ->read
         Throw Exceptions. Even warnings are exceptions now. You can't
          catch them, but you can toggle a switch to make them die()
          instead of warn. ( local $Gentoo::Overlay::Exceptions::WARNINGS_ARE='fatal'; )
         Added an ( currently undocumented ) iteration interface.
